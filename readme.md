# Resist Blockchain

**Resist** is a revolutionary social media blockchain built on **Cosmos SDK** that implements **radical acceptance**, **restorative justice**, and **continued education** principles. Created with [Ignite CLI](https://ignite.com/cli), this blockchain enables a new paradigm for online discourse focused on the betterment of humankind, promoting peace and cooperation, and sharing truth.

## üåü Core Philosophy

### Radical Acceptance
- **No Traditional Censorship**: Content remains accessible with educational context
- **Open Dialogue**: All voices heard with proper source citation and community wisdom
- **Educational Focus**: Learning and understanding over punishment

### Restorative Justice
- **Community-Driven Moderation**: Collective responsibility for discourse quality
- **Evidence-Based Reporting**: Factual foundation for all moderation actions
- **Growth-Focused Resolutions**: Learning outcomes rather than punitive measures

### Continued Education
- **Source Citation Requirements**: All claims must be backed by credible sources
- **ML-Powered Analysis**: AI-assisted fact-checking and source credibility scoring
- **Community Wisdom Integration**: Collective intelligence guides discourse

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Development Setup

```bash
# Start the blockchain in development mode
ignite chain serve

# Reset and start fresh (if needed)
ignite chain serve --verbose --reset-once
```

### API Development

The blockchain provides comprehensive **REST/gRPC APIs** for lite node development:

- **Identity**: Authentication and user profiles

See `api-documentation.md` for complete endpoint specifications.

### Testing Status ‚úÖ

Comprehensive testing completed with full validation of:
- Authentication system functionality
- Voting and consensus mechanisms
- Content moderation workflow
- Governance proposal system
- Source citation and tagging
- API endpoint functionality

See `TEST-VALIDATION-REPORT.md` for detailed validation results.

## Release
To release a new version of your blockchain, create and push a new tag with `v` prefix. A new draft release with the configured targets will be created.

```
git tag v0.1
git push origin v0.1
```

After a draft release is created, make your final changes from the release page and publish it.

### Install
To install the latest version of your blockchain node's binary, execute the following command on your machine:

```
curl https://get.ignite.com/username/resist@latest! | sudo bash
```
`username/resist` should match the `username` and `repo_name` of the Github repository to which the source code was pushed. Learn more about [the install process](https://github.com/ignite/installer).
