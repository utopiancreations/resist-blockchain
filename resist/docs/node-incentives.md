# 💰 Resist Network Node Incentive System

## Overview

The Resist Network employs a sophisticated incentive system that rewards node operators for contributing resources, maintaining uptime, and supporting the decentralized social network ecosystem.

## 🎯 Core Incentive Principles

1. **Resource-Based Rewards**: Compensation scales with actual resource contribution
2. **Quality Over Quantity**: Higher rewards for reliable, high-performance nodes
3. **Network Health**: Incentives aligned with overall network stability and growth
4. **Community Value**: Additional rewards for nodes that enhance user experience
5. **Long-Term Commitment**: Bonus multipliers for established, long-running nodes

## 💎 Token Economics

### Base Token: $RESIST
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 RESIST (1 billion)
- **Inflation Rate**: 7% annually (decreasing by 1% each year, minimum 3%)
- **Distribution**: 60% node rewards, 25% development, 10% community, 5% treasury

### Reward Distribution Schedule
```
Year 1: 70,000,000 RESIST (7% of total supply)
Year 2: 60,000,000 RESIST (6% of remaining supply)
Year 3: 50,000,000 RESIST (5% of remaining supply)
Year 4+: 30,000,000 RESIST (3% of remaining supply, permanent)
```

## 🏆 Reward Categories

### 1. Validator Rewards (40% of total rewards)
**Requirements**: Minimum 10,000 RESIST staked, >95% uptime

**Base Reward Calculation**:

- **Network Governance**: Voting on proposals and upgrades
- **Developer Contributions**: Code commits, bug reports, improvements

**Mobile Mini-Node Rewards**:
```
Daily Reward = App Usage Hours × Data Sync Contribution × Base Mobile Rate
```

**Governance Participation**:
```
Monthly Reward = Proposals Voted On × Vote Weight × Participation Bonus
```

### 4. Long-Term Commitment Rewards (10% of total rewards)
**Time-Based Multipliers**:
- **1-3 months**: 1.0x base rewards
- **3-6 months**: 1.1x base rewards
- **6-12 months**: 1.25x base rewards
- **1-2 years**: 1.5x base rewards
- **2+ years**: 2.0x base rewards

**Slashing Protection**:
- Gradual slashing reduction based on node age
- Emergency fund for hardware failures
- Community insurance pool for established nodes

## 🔄 Dynamic Resource Marketplace

### Supply and Demand Pricing
Resources are priced dynamically based on network demand:

```
Resource Price = Base Price × (Demand / Supply) × Quality Score
```

### Resource Quality Metrics
- **Latency**: Response time for API calls and data retrieval
- **Reliability**: Uptime percentage and consistency
- **Geographic Distribution**: Regional diversity bonus
- **Capacity**: Available resources vs. utilized resources

### Bidding System
1. **Resource Registration**: Nodes register available resources
2. **Capacity Bidding**: Set prices for different resource levels
3. **Automatic Matching**: Network matches supply with demand
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous quality assessment
5. **Payment Distribution**: Automated reward distribution
